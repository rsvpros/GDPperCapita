"1. On January 2, 2019, two new county equivalents were created from the former Valdez-Cordova Census Area, Alaska (02261): Chugach Census Area (02063) and Copper River Census Area (02066). Current-dollar estimates for 2020 forward reflect these changes. Real (chained-dollar) estimates displayed in this table, however, are not available.",
"2. Virginia combination areas consist of one or two independent cities with populations of less than 100,000, combined with an adjacent county. The county name appears first, followed by the city name(s). Separate estimates for the jurisdictions making up the combination areas are not available.",
